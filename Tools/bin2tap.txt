Program convert input file into CODE block in .tap file. Program can create simple BASIC loader too. Program syntax is as follow:

bin2tap [options] input_file
All options are optional except input file name. If some option is requied and not set, it's used default value. Options are:

-a address             start address of CODE block, default value is 32768
-o output_file         assign output .tap file. If this switch is not set,
                       program try to replace extension of input file
                       (extension is search in last 4 characters) by .tap
                       extension. If he's not successfull, join extension
                       after name of input file.

-b                     this switch include BASIC loader in output file
-c clear_address       set address in CLEAR command in loader, default value
                       is 24575
-r run_address         set run address in loader (RANDOMIZE USR), defaul value
                       is 32768
-cb value              set BORDER colour to value, default value is 0
-cp value              set PAPER colour to value, default value is 0
-ci value              set INK colour to value, default value is 7
-d80                   create D80 loader, name of BASIC loader is set to "run"
-append                append created tap at end of file
-hp | --header-poke    include POKE 23739,111 command for dissabling tape headers

-h  | --help           print usage information
-v  | --version        print program version
